# Changelog

## 0.7.1 - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Improved Edge PDF selection recovery after scrolling, zooming, or renderer changes. Accessibility activation is now window-scoped, rate-limited, and refreshable after an empty read instead of being attempted only once per process.
- Continue through fresh focused/document candidates when a hit or ancestor node has expired, while still rejecting password-protected paths before reading any text.
- Search current visible document branches near the selection instead of limiting fallback to the first eight document nodes. Embedded renderer candidates must have verified ownership of the target browser window.
- Cancel the underlying selection read when its time budget expires so later gestures can recover when the external provider responds to cancellation. Physical reader concurrency remains bounded.

### Diagnostics

- Distinguish an empty selection from cancellation or translation failure, and include privacy-safe selection and Edge recovery counters in performance diagnostics.
- Added 21 regression cases for detached nodes, visible/deep document traversal, renderer ownership, refresh timing, cancellation, and selection outcomes.

### Known limitations

- Zotero's built-in PDF reader remains unresolved. The existing companion plugin is unchanged and can be rejected by Zotero 9.0.6; this release does not claim to fix or validate Zotero selection translation.
- Automated tests cover the recovery logic, not every Edge build or PDF. Manual Edge PDF verification of the newly packaged v0.7.1 executable is still pending.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Added a compact question bar below completed translations and explanations. Each translation popup owns an independent multi-turn AI conversation window with streamed answers, stop, retry, copy, resize, zoom, pin, and close controls.
- Added a bottom-right DeepSeek quick-chat launcher to every translation popup. It opens one reusable, compact, topmost conversation window, streams concise answers in the question's language, and sends no translation context or AI-history records.
- Added opt-in AI history. Completed explanations and answers for the same selection are atomically stored in one schema-marked Markdown file under a user-selected directory; disabled, cancelled, failed, and partial results write nothing.
- Added on-demand AI summaries for today, the last seven days, or all schema-marked InstantTranslate records. Summaries are classified, streamed through the existing DeepSeek configuration, and written as new non-overwriting Markdown files.
- Added a loopback-only Zotero selection bridge and companion Zotero 7–9 plugin. It reads only the current built-in PDF-reader selection and does not access the Zotero library or system clipboard.
- Added a compact top-left size preset panel to translation, explanation, contextual Q&A, and DeepSeek quick-chat windows. It provides one-click small, medium, large, wide, tall, and square layouts while preserving manual edge resizing.
- Added an always-visible, directly draggable text-size slider to every translation, explanation, contextual Q&A, and DeepSeek quick-chat window. Translation and explanation share a live size, while each conversation window controls its own transcript.
- Added explicit `Record` actions to completed explanations, contextual Q&A, and DeepSeek quick chat. A click appends the complete valuable content to one schema-marked Markdown file per local day in the user-selected folder, even when automatic AI history is disabled.
- Added a `Code / 代码` action to completed translation popups. It treats the original selection as code, streams a Chinese analysis of the likely language, common use, meaning, important logic, alternatives, and caveats, and reuses the explain overlay, cancellation, copy, follow-up, and Record flows.
- Added AI-selected inline emphasis for translations, explanations, code analyses, contextual Q&A, and DeepSeek quick chat. DeepSeek can mark up to three short key phrases; the client safely renders three emphasis levels while keeping copied, recorded, and follow-up text clean.
- Added independent AI emphasis palettes in Settings: Clarity, Morandi, Ocean, Warm, and High contrast. Palette changes update open popups immediately without changing the main accent color or popup style.

### Changed

- Added lighter opaque mist surfaces for explanation and Q&A while preserving actual window opacity at 1 and retaining system colors in high-contrast mode.
- Isolated Q&A and explanation work from the foreground translation path with independent low-priority concurrency, cancellation, request versions, and timeout protection.
- Increased UI Automation traversal depth for Chromium/Adobe PDF trees, added a bounded top-level `Document` fallback, and allowed a longer non-clipboard stabilization window for Edge PDF selections.
- Added a short, reversible Edge accessibility activation pulse before PDF selection reads. This enables Edge's otherwise dormant UI Automation document tree without modifying browser shortcuts, injecting keys, or using the clipboard.
- Added a dedicated, generously sized top drag handle with hover feedback and enlarged native edge/corner resize hit targets with explicit resize cursors, keeping the translation text area selectable.
- Kept preset resizing anchored at the window's current position, clamped the result to the active monitor, replaced the `S / M / L` letters with progressively sized window-outline icons, and aligned all six presets plus the direct font slider in one compact row.
- Removed the extra `Aa` expansion step, updated large-type line spacing in conversation transcripts, and reserved enough automatic popup height for the persistent control panel without hiding translated text.
- Pinned local builds to the .NET 8 SDK family so a newer incomplete SDK installation cannot silently take over the WPF toolchain.
- Kept malformed or partial AI emphasis transport markers out of the visible text during streaming, so unfinished metadata can never leak into a popup, selection, clipboard copy, or Markdown record.

### Privacy

- AI history remains off by default and clearly identifies its files as plain, readable Markdown. Manual daily records are written only after an explicit `Record` click; the app refuses to overwrite a same-named foreign file and sends automatic-history records for summarization only after the user clicks AI Summary.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Added AI Explain for a completed translation. It can explain either the original selection or a selected passage in the translated text, streams a concise Chinese explanation, and keeps the result in the same popup.
- Isolated explanation requests from translation requests, with per-window cancellation, a low-priority concurrency slot, timeout protection, retry, copy, and return controls.
- Added an optional Bubble popup style in Settings. It uses an opaque pastel surface, soft shadow, rounded controls, and a tail that points toward the selection side while preserving the existing Minimal style as the default.
- Added Bubble 2.0 as a separate popup style, with a fuller rounded silhouette, attached soft tail, white highlight, and opaque pastel blue, lavender, and pink surface.
- Added a smooth local reveal queue for streamed translations and explanations: the first content remains immediate, then newly received text fills in progressively without waiting for the whole response.

### Fixed

- Clipped Bubble popup content and explanation overlays to the same rounded surface geometry so the two lower corners cannot expose square edges.
- Retried safe UI Automation/native selection reads after mouse-up for Edge, Chromium, and Zotero document readers, and accepted same-process focused document nodes that do not expose a native window handle. This improves PDF selection pickup without enabling clipboard fallback.

### Privacy

- AI Explain content is never written to settings, translation memory, caches, or diagnostics.

## 0.5.4 - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- Moved the top and upper-corner resize targets from the detached action toolbar to the visible top edge of the translation surface.

## 0.5.3 - 2026-08-23

### Changed

- Dismissed an unpinned popup immediately after a physical left click outside that popup while keeping every pinned result intact.
- Enabled four-edge and four-corner resizing before pinning, with a larger resize hit target.
- Added content-aware initial sizing that grows with mixed Chinese/English text, explicit line breaks, and the selected font size while staying within the active monitor and retaining vertical scrolling for long results.

## 0.5.2 - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- Moved hit testing and subscriber work out of the low-level mouse callback, serialized hook lifecycle changes, added session and 15-minute rebind recovery, and made the global hotkey recover after an unexpected message-loop exit.
- Isolated UI Automation reads by target process, bounded physical reads, enabled best-effort COM call cancellation, and continued to safe native fallbacks after target-provider faults.
- Stopped ordinary external clicks from canceling a translation, bounded duplicate in-flight waits, and ensured joined or empty-result failures have a request window that can display an error.
- Retried DeepSeek connection timeouts that arrive as uncancelled `OperationCanceledException`, classified stream disconnects, and retried a stream failure only before any content has been emitted.
- Loaded Windows credentials off the startup/UI thread and prevented delayed credential recovery or a stale settings dialog from deleting a valid API key.
- Released the single-instance claim before lengthy shutdown cleanup, added activation acknowledgement, and extended graceful takeover so immediate relaunch no longer leaves both processes closed.
- Fixed canceling a pinned popup when another transient popup exists, preserved the last complete result after a failed retranslation, and kept language reversal disabled until streaming completes.
- Enabled explicit Per-Monitor V2 DPI awareness, bounded popup size to the current work area, and allowed manually widened text content to use the full window width.
- Prevented unreadable encrypted translation memory from being overwritten and restored safe non-clipboard Scintilla selection reading through system messages.

### Added

- Added a small rotating, privacy-safe lifecycle journal plus UIA and popup counts to copied diagnostics. These records never include selected text, translations, API keys, endpoints, or paths.
- Added regression coverage for credential startup, UIA slot poisoning, network/VPN timeout recovery, stream disconnects, shutdown takeover, malformed settings, and corrupt translation memory.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- Made global mouse capture recover automatically when Windows is still completing login, when the native hook exits unexpectedly, or when the user explicitly chooses the tray repair command.
- Kept the app resident and retried input capture instead of closing the whole application when the first hook binding is temporarily unavailable.

### Added

- Added a tray command to repair input capture without exiting the app.
- Added privacy-safe input-capture status to diagnostics: hook state and the time of the most recent physical mouse-button event only. It never includes selected text, translations, API credentials, endpoints, or paths.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Added process-local performance diagnostics for selection reads, queueing, first content, total latency, cache hits, and coalesced requests; reports deliberately exclude source text, translations, credentials, endpoints, and paths.
- Added duplicate in-flight request coalescing so identical concurrent translations share one provider request while the owner continues to stream.
- Added explicit correction editing in the popup and a DPAPI-protected translation memory containing only corrections the user chooses to save.
- Added exact saved-correction hits plus up to three bounded relevant examples for future requests, with a clear-all control in Settings.
- Added automatic Windows high-contrast palette handling and popup keyboard commands for correction editing, pinning, copying, and text sizing.
- Added optional Authenticode signing and signature verification to the release script without changing the unsigned default.

### Changed

- Added bounded exponential-jitter retries and a short circuit-breaker cooldown for transient DeepSeek network, timeout, rate-limit, and server failures.
- Increased the configurable translation font maximum from 30 to 34 and reduced repeated allocation during relevant-example matching.
- Classified provider errors explicitly so configuration and authentication failures do not trigger transient-failure recovery.

### Security

- Kept ordinary translations ephemeral; persistent memory is created only after an explicit correction save and is encrypted for the current Windows account.
- Limited saved memory to 200 entries and relevant provider examples to three pairs within a 2,400-character budget.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- Reduced the in-memory translation cache to 128 entries, about one million characters, and a 20-minute TTL while preserving instant repeat-translation hits.
- Replaced retained source text in cache keys with SHA-256 fingerprints, reducing memory retention and strengthening in-process privacy.
- Bounded multi-range UI Automation context reads to 3,000 characters in total and reused prepared glossary/mode/style data across cache and provider stages.
- Tuned pooled HTTP/2 connections and active-request keep-alive behavior for faster recovery after network or VPN changes.

### Fixed

- Explicitly release popup HWND hooks, rich-text documents, animations, and delayed feedback work when a popup closes, preventing avoidable memory growth during long sessions.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Added opt-in surrounding-paragraph context from UI Automation without using the clipboard.
- Added fast, balanced, and precise translation modes plus natural, formal, concise, academic, and technical writing styles.
- Added a local personal glossary with `source => preferred translation` entries; only terms matching the current selection are sent.
- Added cache isolation for context, mode, style, matching terminology, and prompt-version changes.
- Added separate first-content and streaming-idle timeouts within the existing total request budget.

### Changed

- Reworked DeepSeek input as structured, untrusted translation data so context and terminology remain separate from instructions.
- Delayed the initial popup until translated content arrives, removing the animated waiting state.
- Refined the popup into a quieter content surface with an on-demand text-size control and a unified source/translation copy group.
- Refined the neutral palette, spacing, corner relationships, accessibility names, and Settings presentation around a content-first hierarchy.

### Security

- Kept surrounding-context sharing disabled by default and documented exactly when extra text is sent.
- Continued to keep source text, translations, and context out of persistent history; glossary preferences are stored locally.
- Explicitly reject UI Automation password elements and native Edit controls carrying the Windows password style.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- Changed automatic selection reading to prefer UI Automation and direct Win32/RichEdit/Scintilla selection messages, so ordinary selections no longer modify the system clipboard.
- Made the WM_COPY compatibility fallback opt-in from Settings and documented its clipboard side effects for custom-rendered applications.

### Fixed

- Fixed automatic dragging/selection potentially replacing or altering content that the user had already copied.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Added an English-first interface with a one-click English / 中文 switch in Settings; the saved language also applies to popup prompts, tray commands, notifications, and validation messages.
- Added separate English and Chinese translation-font settings. English options include Times New Roman, Arial, Source Sans Pro, Georgia, Calibri, and Cambria; Chinese options include SimHei, Microsoft YaHei UI, SimSun, and KaiTi.
- Bundled Source Sans Pro under the SIL Open Font License so non-translation interface text is consistent even when the font is not installed on Windows.
- Added migration and localization coverage for old settings, invalid font values, aliases, and provider errors.

### Changed

- Made Times New Roman and SimHei the respective default English and Chinese translation fonts.
- Standardized popup controls on a 24×24 icon coordinate system with consistent 34×32 hit areas.
- Replaced ambiguous copy badges with readable source/translation S and T markers, and redrew the pin icon for clearer visual weight.
- Applied saved interface-language and translation-font changes to open popup windows after Settings is saved.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Added single-instance activation so repeated launches reuse the running app.
- Added `Ctrl+Shift+T` and a tray command to translate text the user copied manually.
- Added a process-local LRU translation cache with TTL and memory limits.
- Added a close button, visible copy feedback, saved default font size, a scrollable settings window, API connection testing, API-key clearing, version status, and an About entry.
- Added complete tests for cache, streaming throttling, single-instance coordination, secure Endpoint validation, UIA process boundaries, and selection fallback policies.

### Changed

- Coalesced streaming UI updates and incrementally appended translation runs to keep long output responsive.
- Refined the popup into a compact, solid action strip plus an opaque, light-gray, borderless reading surface with clearer interaction states.
- Reorganized settings into three restrained cards with consistent controls, a fixed save bar, and an independently scrollable content area.
- Applied the configured accent theme to popup actions, selection, feedback, and pin state without adding glass, shadows, or decorative effects.
- Kept an in-progress pinned translation independent from the next transient selection.
- Increased the translation timeout to 60 seconds and made the coordinator the single owner of request timeouts.
- Required HTTPS for remote API Endpoints while continuing to allow local HTTP development servers.
- Made settings writes use unique same-directory temporary files before atomic replacement.

### Fixed

- Fixed a timeout race that could leave the loading popup visible indefinitely.
- Fixed provider failures and unexpected cancellation causing a popup to disappear without an explanation.
- Fixed repeated full FlowDocument rebuilding and repeated popup positioning for every streamed token.
- Fixed read-only translation text showing an unusable Paste command.
- Fixed theme choices being saved but not reflected in the popup.
- Fixed pinned translations being canceled when a new selection began.
- Fixed duplicate launches creating multiple tray icons, hooks, requests, and potential API charges.
- Fixed manual popup resizing clipping long or large text instead of providing a bounded, vertically scrollable reading area.
- Fixed the no-activate window style preventing normal text focus, drag selection, selection highlighting, and keyboard copy after an intentional click.
- Fixed a fully opaque selection overlay hiding the selected glyphs; the highlight now remains clear while the text stays readable.

### Security

- Removed every automatic keyboard-copy path; the app never synthesizes `Ctrl+C`.
- Serialized automatic clipboard transactions, stopped clearing the clipboard before copy, limited `WM_COPY` to the hit window and its same-process root, and avoided overwriting third-party clipboard updates.
- Restricted UI Automation focused-element reads to the same process as the pointer hit target.
- Rejected selection gestures whose start and end points belong to different processes.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-10

- Added global mouse-selection translation through Windows UI Automation.
- Added low-latency DeepSeek streaming translation and automatic language routing.
- Added no-focus translation popups with copy, language switch, pin, drag, resize, and font controls.
- Added application, window, and system-tray branding.
- Added request cancellation, secure API-key storage, and automated tests.
